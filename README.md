# Joji – SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I don't want a friend i want my life in two
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs can you? Can you
Give me reasons we should be complete?
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else
Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance
In the dark, dark
When you gotta run just hear my voice in you
Shutting me out, you doing so great
You
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
I don't fuck with your tone
I don't wanna go home can it be one night?
Can you? Can you
Give me reasons we should be complete?
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, no
Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance
In the dark, dark in the dark, dark
