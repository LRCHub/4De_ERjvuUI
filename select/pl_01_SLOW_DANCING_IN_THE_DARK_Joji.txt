I don't want a friend
I want my life in two
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you
When I'm around
Slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me,
You'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons
We should be complete
You should be with him,
I can't compete
You looked at me like
I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance
In the dark, dark
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you
Shutting me out of you
Doing so great
You
Used to be the one
To hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't fuck with your tone
I don't wanna go home
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons
We should be complete
You should be with him,
I can't compete
You looked at me like
I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
